## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt that sometimes, way too many styles spoil the code. And no, I will not explain further. But think about it. Sometimes, mean lean code can get the job done. In fact, I think that should be the goal.

### Continued development

Of course, I'm gonna keep grinding with HTML and SCSS till I get great at it. I also plan on getting back on my Javascript lessons.
